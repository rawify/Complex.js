Complex.js is a well tested JavaScript library to work with [complex number arithmetic](https://raw.org/book/analysis/complex-numbers/) in JavaScript. It implements every elementary complex number manipulation function and the API is intentionally similar to [Fraction.js](https://github.com/rawify/Fraction.js). Furthermore, it's the basis of [Polynomial.js](https://github.com/rawify/Polynomial.js) and [Math.js](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs).


## Examples


```js
let Complex = require('complex.js');

let c = new Complex("99.3+8i");
c.mul({re: 3, im: 9}).div(4.9).sub(3, 2);
```

A classical use case for complex numbers is solving quadratic equations `ax² + bx + c = 0` for all `a, b, c ∈ ℝ`:

```js

function quadraticRoot(a, b, c) {
  let sqrt = Complex(b * b - 4 * a * c).sqrt()
  let x1 = Complex(-b).add(sqrt).div(2 * a)
  let x2 = Complex(-b).sub(sqrt).div(2 * a)
  return {x1, x2}
}

// quadraticRoot(1, 4, 5) -> -2 ± i
```

For cubic roots have a look at [RootFinder](https://github.com/rawify/RootFinder.js) which uses Complex.js.

## Parser


Any function (see below) as well as the constructor of the *Complex* class parses its input like this.

You can pass either Objects, Doubles or Strings.

### Objects

```javascript
new Complex({re: real, im: imaginary});
new Complex({arg: angle, abs: radius});
new Complex({phi: angle, r: radius});
new Complex([real, imaginary]); // Vector/Array syntax
```
If there are other attributes on the passed object, they're not getting preserved and have to be merged manually.

**Note:** Object attributes have to be of type Number to avoid undefined behavior.

### Doubles

```javascript
new Complex(55.4);
```

### Strings

```javascript
new Complex("123.45");
new Complex("15+3i");
new Complex("i");
```

### Two arguments

```javascript
new Complex(3, 2); // 3+2i
```

## Attributes


Every complex number object exposes its real and imaginary part as attribute `re` and `im`:

```javascript
let c = new Complex(3, 2);

console.log("Real part:", c.re); // 3
console.log("Imaginary part:", c.im); // 2
```

Array toVector()
---

String toString()
---
Returns a string representation of the actual number. As of v1.9.0 the output is a bit more human readable

```javascript

new Complex(0, 1).toString(); // i
new Complex(9, 0).toString(); // 9
new Complex(1, 1).toString(); // 1 + i
```

double valueOf()
---
Returns the real part of the number if imaginary part is zero. Otherwise `null`


## Trigonometric functions

The following trigonometric functions are defined on Complex.js:

| Trig | Arcus | Hyperbolic | Area-Hyperbolic |
|------|-------|------------|------------------|
| sin()  | asin()  | sinh()       | asinh()            |
| cos()  | acos()  | cosh()       | acosh()            |
| tan()  | atan()  | tanh()       | atanh()            |
| cot()  | acot()  | coth()       | acoth()            |
| sec()  | asec()  | sech()       | asech()            |
| csc()  | acsc()  | csch()       | acsch()            |

**Notes on branches & ranges.** Inverse trig on ℂ needs a branch choice. For `acot` there are two real-axis conventions:

* **(Chosen) Textbook range (0, π) on ℝ.**
  Gives familiar real values (`acot(1)=π/4`, `acot(0)=π/2`, `acot(-1)=3π/4`). With the principal complex branch this **necessarily causes a π jump across the negative real axis** (e.g., near `-1±i0` → `-π/4`, but on `-1` → `3π/4`).
  **We implement this with `atan2(1, x)`** to select the correct quadrant and handle `x=0`.

* **Alternative range (−π/2, π/2] on ℝ.**
  Makes `acot(-1) = -π/4` and can avoid that specific jump **only if the entire complex branch is changed to match**. Using plain `atan(1/x)` silently adopts this convention, changes real outputs, is undefined at `x=0`, and still wouldn’t resolve the complex behavior without a broader policy change.

We therefore prefer predictable, textbook real values and robust quadrant handling—hence `atan2(1, x)`-accepting the implied branch cut on ℝ⁻ by design.


## Geometric Equivalence


Complex numbers can also be seen as a vector in the 2D space. Here is a simple overview of basic operations and how to implement them with complex.js:

New vector
---
```js
let v1 = new Complex(1, 0);
let v2 = new Complex(1, 1);
```

Scale vector
---
```js
scale(v1, factor):= v1.mul(factor)
```

Vector norm
---
```js
norm(v):= v.abs()
```

Translate vector
---
```js
translate(v1, v2):= v1.add(v2)
```

Rotate vector around center
---
```js
rotate(v, angle):= v.mul({abs: 1, arg: angle})
```

Rotate vector around a point
---
```js
rotate(v, p, angle):= v.sub(p).mul({abs: 1, arg: angle}).add(p)
```

Distance to another vector
---
```js
distance(v1, v2):= v1.sub(v2).abs()
```

## Constants


Complex.ZERO
---
A complex zero value (south pole on the Riemann Sphere)

Complex.ONE
---
A complex one instance

Complex.INFINITY
---
A complex infinity value (north pole on the Riemann Sphere)

Complex.NAN
---
A complex NaN value (not on the Riemann Sphere)

Complex.I
---
An imaginary number i instance

Complex.PI
---
A complex PI instance

Complex.E
---
A complex euler number instance

Complex.EPSILON
---
A small epsilon value used for `equals()` comparison in order to circumvent double imprecision.

```

Alternatively, download or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rawify/Complex.js
```

## Usage

Include the `complex.min.js` file in your project:

```html
<script src="path/to/complex.min.js"></script>
<script>
    console.log(Complex("4+3i"));
</script>

## Coding Style

As every library I publish, Complex.js is also built to be as small as possible after compressing it with Google Closure Compiler in advanced mode. Thus the coding style orientates a little on maxing-out the compression rate. Please make sure you keep this style if you plan to extend the library.

## Building the library

After cloning the Git repository run:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## Run a test

Testing the source against the shipped test suite is as easy as

```
npm run test
```
